# Statistics-101B-Final-Project

This repository contains the files for the final project for Statistics 101B. I took the class during the Spring 2021 quarter.

The purpose of the project was to collaboarate in a group to propose an experimental design that would best be able to identify the relevant factors that would produce the best garden sprinkler. The most important factors that would optimize the sprinker's quality characteristics were then analyzed
